# Pac-Man AI
Using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train a neural network to beat Pac-Man

<h2>The Ghosts' Mechanics (same used in actual Pac-Man)</h2>

<h2>Variations From Regular Pac-Man</h2>
In normal Pac-Man, ghosts have "chase mode" and "scatter mode". Chase mode is when the ghosts are actively pursuing Pac-Man, while chase mode happens for short intervals to give the player a break. Each ghost redirects their target tile to one of the corners of the maze. I did not add this as I wanted this to be more difficult than the regular Pac-Man since I only have one level.

There is also usually "power pellets" that give Pac-Man the ability to eat the ghosts for a temporary time. For the same reason as above, I did not add these.
